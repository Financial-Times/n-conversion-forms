/**
 * This is a static list of messages for delivery options. The items are created by the combination of some distributor properties:
 * - deliveryFrequency (A1, A5, A6) - is defined based on the selected product (codes containing NWE, N5D, N6D).
 *   -> Product, containing N6D as print part (e.g. P2N6D, P1N6D, N6D) corresponds to delivery frequency A6.
 *   -> Product, containing N5D as print part corresponds to frequency A5.
 *   -> Product, containing NWE as print part (e.g. NWE and P2NWE) corresponds to frequency A1.
 * - distributorType - 'Mail' if the distributor fulfilment type is mail, otherwise is 'Hand Delivery'
 * - deliveryOnPublicationDate - true if the distributor can deliver on the publication date, otherwise there will be 1-3 days delay in deliveries
 * - flightMarket: if the distributor is in a fly market or not (newspapers shipping may be affected by flight schedule changes)
 * - country
