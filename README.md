## Requirements

For installing dependencies, running the build process and the documentation app

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)

## Usage

This repository contains HTML and CSS that can be used in your projects.

### HTML

The `partials` directory contains [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template files. Use these as partials within your templates by looping over the files in the directory and register them with Handlebars

```js
Handlebars.registerPartial(fileName, fileContents);
```

### CSS

The styles can be used by including the `main.scss` file within your own SASS files.

```scss
@import 'n-conversion-forms/main';
```

### JS

The utils can be used by including the individual file from within your own JS files. For more information see the [Utilities](#utilities) section below.

```js
import MyModule from 'n-conversion-forms/utils/my-module';
```

## Utilities

### Country

```js
const country = new Country(document);

// Get the value on change
country.onChange(() => {
  const selected = country.getSelected();
});
```

Adds listener for country changes and retrieve the currently selected value.


### Email

```js
const email = new Email(document);
```

This utility provides the following:

+ If a confirm email field is present will validate to ensure the email addresses match and present the user with an error if not.
+ Registering an email exists lookup as follows:

    ```js
    email.registerEmailExistsCheck(backendServiceUrl, onFoundCallback, onNotFoundCallback);
    ```
  
  **NB** It's recommended you have a hidden `#csrfToken` input element that you validate the request with in your backend service to prevent having your service abused.

  The backend service will be sent the following as the body of a `POST` request: `{ email, csrfToken }`.

### Event Notifier

TBD

### Password

```js
const password = new Password(document);
```

This utility's sole purpose (currently) is to enable the functionality behind the `Show password` checkbox that toggles whether the password is masked or not.

### PaymentTerm

```js
const paymentTerm = new PaymentTerm(document);

// Return the currently selected payment term
paymentTerm.getSelected();

// Update the payment term options displayed
const options = [{
  name: 'Name of term',
  value: 'Value to send',
  description: 'Can contain <strong>HTML</strong>'
}];
paymentTerm.updateOptions(options);
```

Update and get the currently selected payment term on the form

### PaymentType

```js
const paymentType = new PaymentType(document);

// Show payment type
paymentType.show(PaymentType.APPLEPAY);

// Hide payment type
paymentType.hide(PaymentType.CREDITCARD);
```

Allows the control of which payment types are shown to the user. It relies on the `{{> payment-type }}` partial being used and has `show` and `hide` methods.

The following payment types are allowed:

```js
PaymentType.CREDITCARD
PaymentType.DIRECTDEBIT
PaymentType.PAYPAL
PaymentType.APPLEPAY
```

### Tracking

```js
const tracking = new Tracking(window, document.body);
```

TBD

### Validation

```js
const validation = new Validation();
validation.init();
```

This utility will set up the form for client side validation using [`o-forms`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-forms#javascript).

**NB:** By default, using this utility will prompt the user with a dialog before leaving the page if there have been changes on the form. It can be disabled as follows: `new Validation({mutePromptBeforeLeaving: true})`

One useful property made available is the main form DOM element via `validation.$form`. Use this for scoping `querySelector` calls to find elements within your form.
